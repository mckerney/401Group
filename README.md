I uploaded MP3Player.java. I got a basic framework that should so how we need to handle the class flow and polymorphism so we can get the MediaPlayer methods present in our instance of the player. Feel free to check it out and add anything. I had a few extra hours today so I got it up, I will try and put a few more hours to flesh out the framework tomorrow and see if we can get some button graphics rolling as well.
